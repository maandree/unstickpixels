.SH NAME
unstickpixels \- Screen loop to try to unstick stuck dots
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B unstickpixels
[-v]
.RI [ interval ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unstickpixels
shall cycle the colours on the screen between
sRGB(100 %, 0, 0), sRGB(0, 100 %, 0), and sRGB(0, 0, 100 %),
as fast as possible, or sleep
.I interval
milliseconds between each switch.
.PP
You should disable powersaving on your monitors and disable
the screensaver whilst running this program, or otherwise
make sure that screen loop is always displayed.
.PP
Running this program for a number of hours, especially if
combined with massaging defective dots, may heal defective
dots. Dead dots (always black) are hard to revive, but
stuck dots are more probable to get fixed.
.PP
You must not run this program if you are epileptic. Seek
someone else how can do it for you.
.PP
.B unstickpixels
uses the graphics cards' colour lookup tables
to switch the colour displayed on the screen. If your
computers does not supports this, the option
.B -v
may help, it will use the framebuffer indirectly, via the
terminal. Unless 
.B -v
is used,
.B unstickpixels
runs both in
.B X
and on the Linux VT.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-v
Use the Linux VT instead of the graphics cards'
colour lookup tables (CLUT). This requires that the
program runs under the Linux VT, otherwise known
as the TTY. This may not work too great one all
graphics cards, some very expensive graphics cards
are really bad. NVIDIA is known case of this,
why the CLUT utilisation was added.

If you are using a graphical environment and do not
know how to access the Linux VT, here is how you do
it: press
.BR Ctrl+Alt+F1 ,
if this does not open non-graphical login screen, press
.B Alt+Right
until you get one. To get back to graphical environment,
hold down
.B Alt+Right
until it appears.

Whilst unstickpixels may run on most systems (although
Mir and, by Wayland's design, Wayland are not supported)
this option is only known to function on Linux.
.SH RATIONALE
Acer/Packard Bell is not willing to repair all defects on
my computer, but at least I can run this for several hours
and try to revive dead pixels. Playing back a video that is
already available on the Internet has some deficiencies:
.TP
*
Requires a graphics card and video player that can
play back the video in full screen mode efficiently.
.TP
*
Requires
.B X
or a video player than can play video outside
.B X
efficiently.
.TP
*
Requires the video to be downloaded if it was uploaded
on Youtube, because Youtube does not properly support
full screen.
.TP
*
One video playback is required per defective monitor.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
No similar or otherwise related programs known, please
file a bug if you know any.
.TP
There are some similar works in form of videos available
on the Internet.
